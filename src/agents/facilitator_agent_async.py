"""
Facilitator Agent Module

This module defines the FacilitatorAgentAsync class, which facilitates an interactive 
conversation with a user about a main concept and its related sub-concepts.

The agent leverages language models (LLMs) to generate dynamic questions, 
evaluate user responses, and maintain a conversation memory for context
and future reference.

The agent supports multiple LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Claude, LLaMA 3) 
and can route API calls to the specified provider using the call_llm_async method.

Example usage:
    # Run the facilitator agent
    asyncio.run(main())


TODO: Needed to handle "I don't know type of question"
TODO: Need to add reflective agent
TODO: Need to define roles of different agents and leverage it to dynamically create prompts

        memory_file (Union[Path, str]): Path to the file where conversation history is stored.
        idea_data (IndexedIdeaJSONModel): Data model containing the main idea, thoughts, and sub-thoughts.
        state_manager (StateManager): Instance to track user progress and state.
        llm_provider (str): Provider of the LLM (e.g., "openai").
        model_id (str): Specific model ID for the LLM.
        temperature (float): Temperature for controlling randomness in LLM responses.

        client (Optional[Union[AsyncOpenAI, AsyncAnthropic]]): LLM client instance.
        scoped_logs (List[Dict]): Scoped logs for the current sub-thought.
        conversation_memory (List[Dict]): History of the conversation.

    Methods:
        - `coordinate_conversation`: Orchestrates the flow of the conversation.
        - `discuss_thought`: Discusses all sub-thoughts of a given main thought.
        - `discuss_single_sub_thought`: Handles interaction for a single sub-thought.
        - `log_exchange`: Logs a single exchange between user and agent.
        - `persist_chat_history_to_disk`: Saves the full conversation memory to disk.

        Evaluate a user's response based on a given question and thought context.

        This method integrates with the evaluator agent to analyze the user's response
        and validate the evaluation result. It performs the following transformations:

        1. Input Parameters:
        - `question` (str): The question posed to the user.
        - `user_response` (str): The user's answer to the question.
        - `thought` (IndexedIdeaJSONModel): The context of the current thought being
        discussed.

        2. Call to 'EvaluatorAgentAsync.evaluate_async':
        - Input:
            - 'question': The question posed to the user.
            - 'user_response': The user's answer to the question.
            - `idea` (str): The overarching idea, extracted as `self.idea_data.idea`.
            - `thought` (str): The specific thought being evaluated,
            extracted as `thought.thought`.
        - Output:
            - `evaluation_model` (EvaluationJSONModel): A structured evaluation model
            containing the evaluation results as a nested `evaluation` field of
            type `EvaluationCriteria`.

        3. Validation and Parsing:
        - The `evaluation` field from `EvaluationJSONModel` is validated as
        an `EvaluationCriteria` object using `EvaluationCriteria.model_validate`.
        - This ensures the data conforms to the expected structure.

        4. Model Differences:
        - `EvaluationJSONModel`:
            - Represents the complete evaluation response returned from the evaluator agent.
            - Contains metadata and other fields beyond just the evaluation criteria.
            - Includes the `evaluation` field, which holds the evaluation details.
        - `EvaluationCriteria`:
            - A subset of the `EvaluationJSONModel`, representing only the evaluation details.
            - Includes specific scores (`criteria`), explanations (`explanations`),
            and a `total_score`.

        5. Output:
        - Returns a validated `EvaluationCriteria` object containing:
            - `criteria` (Dict[str, int]): Scoring for specific evaluation dimensions
            (e.g., relevance, clarity).
            - `explanations` (Dict[str, str]): Textual explanations for the scores.
            - `total_score` (float): An aggregated score across all dimensions.
