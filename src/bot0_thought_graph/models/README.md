# Models

This package owns the typed domain and provider-neutral response models used
by the canonical graph package.

## Responsibilities

- `thought_models.py`: concept-first `Thought`, `ThoughtArray`, `ThoughtNode`,
  and `ThoughtGraph` models plus progression types.
- `indexed_thought_models.py`: indexed and legacy-schema thought structures
  still consumed by the canonical engine.
- `llm_response_models.py`: provider-neutral response shapes.
- `evaluation_models.py`: typed evaluation structures retained by the package.

The package-level `__init__.py` exposes the supported model exports from one
stable subpackage boundary.

## Boundaries

Models validate and represent data; they do not call providers, build prompts,
traverse graphs, perform reflection, or persist results. Generation, reflection,
provider, prompt, and storage packages may depend on these types, but models
do not depend on the removed interview/application architecture.
