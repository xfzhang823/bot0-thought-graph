    """Generate, expand, organize, and optionally persist thought structures.

    ``ThoughtGraphEngine`` is the primary public façade for exploring a concept
    as an array or hierarchy of related thoughts.

    The engine supports two complementary workflows:

    1. A concept-first façade for generating major subtopics, expanding one
       subtopic into more-specific details, producing typed thought arrays, and
       constructing bounded thought graphs.
    2. A lower-level typed API based on ``HorizontalGenerationRequest`` and
       ``VerticalGenerationRequest`` for callers that need direct control over
       model settings, prompts, progression types, clustering, or ranking.

    Horizontal generation produces sibling-level dimensions of an idea.
    Vertical generation produces more-specific children beneath a selected
    thought.

    All generation and expansion operations remain in memory. Supplying a
    repository does not enable automatic persistence; callers must invoke
    ``save`` explicitly.

    Attributes:
        provider: Language-model provider used for generation, expansion,
            clustering, and ranking.
        repository: Optional repository used only by explicit ``save`` calls.

            concept-first façade.

        The graph begins with ``concept`` as its root node. The first child
        level is generated horizontally as a set of sibling-level subtopics.
        Each deeper level is generated vertically by expanding each node into
        direct, more-specific children.

        Depth counts generated child levels beneath the root:

        * ``depth=1`` creates the root and its horizontal subtopics.
        * ``depth=2`` additionally expands every first-level subtopic.
        * ``depth=3`` additionally expands every second-level node.

        Legacy ``breadth`` limits the number of children retained at every
        expanded node. New callers can instead use independent
        ``horizontal`` and ``vertical`` values: ``horizontal`` limits the
        root-level peer directions, while ``vertical`` limits generated child
        levels beneath the root. New explicit calls use the internal default

        Adaptive exploration is opt-in when a profile is supplied and cannot

        Explicit graph generation begins with one horizontal provider call.
        Adaptive generation may make additional bounded horizontal candidate
        calls while evaluating continuation. Each node expanded below the
        first level requires an additional vertical provider call. Provider-
        call volume can therefore grow quickly as the graph expands.

        Ranking applies only to the initial horizontal subtopics. Generated
        graphs remain in memory and are not persisted automatically.

            concept: Root concept represented by the graph. Existing callers

            topic: Alias for ``concept`` intended for external callers. Only
                one of ``concept`` and ``topic`` may be supplied.
            depth: Legacy name for the number of generated child levels beneath
                the root. Must be between 1 and ``_MAX_LEGACY_DEPTH``, inclusive.
            breadth: Legacy maximum number of children retained per expanded
                node. It cannot be combined with ``horizontal`` or ``vertical``.
            horizontal: Maximum number of root-level peer directions retained.
                It cannot be combined with ``depth`` or ``breadth``.
