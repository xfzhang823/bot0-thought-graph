Question: {question}
Answer: {answer}

Additional Context:
Idea: {idea}
Thought: {thought}

Carefully evaluate the given answer using a rigorous, systematic approach:

Evaluation Criteria:
1. Relevance: Assess how directly and comprehensively the answer addresses the specific question asked, ESPECIALLY in light of the provided context.
2. Correctness: Verify the factual accuracy and absence of misleading or incorrect information.
3. Specificity: Examine the depth, precision, and level of detail in the answer.
4. Clarity: Evaluate the answer's linguistic quality, logical flow, and ease of understanding.

Scoring Guidelines:
- Score Range: 1-5 (1 = Very Poor, 5 = Excellent)
- Consider multiple dimensions within each criterion
- Provide concise, objective explanations
- Explicitly consider the question context in your evaluation

Special Handling for Insufficient Responses:
- If the answer appears to be a minimal, non-informative response that fails to engage with the question, evaluate the response critically.
(examples: "I don't know", "Not sure", etc.),
- Consider:
  1. Is this a genuine acknowledgment of limited knowledge?
  2. Does the response show any attempt to provide context or partial understanding?
  3. Could the response be expanded or clarified?
- Adjust scores accordingly, potentially lowering scores for relevance, specificity, and clarity if the response is truly uninformative.

Produce a STRICTLY FORMATTED JSON response with the following requirements:
{{
    "evaluation": {{
        "criteria": {{
            "relevance": <integer_score_1_to_5>,

            "clarity": <integer_score_1_to_5>
        }},
        "explanations": {{

        }},
        "total_score": <calculated_average_of_criteria_scores>
