2. Break it down into {num_sub_thoughts} key sub-thoughts
3. Provide a concise description for each sub-thought

Requirements for Sub-Thoughts:
- Must be directly related to the main thought

Requirements for Descriptions:
- Maximum 30 words per description
- Focus on unique, defining characteristics
- Avoid redundancy with the sub-thought name

Return your analysis in the following JSON format:

{{
  "metadata": {{
    "record_id": "{idea}",

RECLUSTER_AND_PICK_TOP_SUB_THOUGHTS_PROMPT = """
You are an expert in organizing complex ideas into distinct, well-defined clusters.

Task:
You are given a list of sub-thoughts related to the main thought: {thought}.
Each sub-thought represents a distinct aspect of this thought, and your task is to re-organize
these sub-thoughts into the {num_clusters} most meaningful and distinct clusters.

Instructions:
1. Carefully analyze the sub-thoughts and group them based on their thematic or conceptual \
  similarities.
2. Provide a name for each cluster that best represents the overall idea of \
  the grouped sub-thoughts.
3. Select and return the top {top_n} clusters that are most distinct from each other and \
  provide a very brief
   description (1-2 sentences) of each cluster's key ideas.

Sub-Thoughts:

2. Select and return only the top {top_n} clusters that are the most distinct from each other.

Instructions:
- Carefully analyze each thought and group them based on thematic or conceptual similarities.
- Provide a unique name for each cluster that best represents its overall theme.
- Ensure each cluster includes thoughts that are non-overlapping and distinct from other clusters.
- After forming {num_clusters} clusters, choose only the top {top_n} clusters that are \

VERTICAL_SUB_THOUGHT_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert in the field of {idea}.
Your goal is to provide structured, step-by-step explanations that break down complex topics

and leads to a deeper understanding of advanced concepts.

Task:
Break down and explain the key aspects of a main thought following a {progression_type} progression.

Progression Types:
1. "simple_to_complex": Start with the most basic concepts and gradually introduce more advanced ideas.
2. "implementation_steps": Describe the key areas or steps one would need to consider when implementing or
   working with the main thought.
3. "chronological": If applicable, explain the evolution or historical development of the main thought.

   their solutions or approaches.

Instructions:
1. Based on the specified progression type **{progression_type}**, determine the most appropriate
   starting point for explaining {thought}.
2. For each subsequent step, explain the sub-thought that logically follows from the previous one,

3. For each step, provide:
   - A clear explanation of the sub-thought
   - Why it's important in the context of {thought}
   - How it connects to the next step (except for the final step)
