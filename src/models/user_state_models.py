class UserState(BaseModel):
    """
    Represents the state of a user in a conversational agent system.

    Attributes:
        thought_index (int): Current thought index in the conversation. Default is 0.
        sub_thought_index (int): Current sub-thought index within the thought. Default is 0.
        current_question (Optional[str]): The current question being discussed. Default is None.
        last_updated (datetime): Timestamp of the last update. Default is the current time.
        skills (Optional[List[str]]): List of user skills or expertise. Default is an empty list.
        session_metadata (Optional[SessionMetadata]): Metadata related to the session.
            Defaults to an instance of `SessionMetadata` with `session_id='default_session'`.

    **Example:**

    >>> Example:
    # Create a default user state
    user1 = UserState()
    print(user1)

    # Output:
    # thought_index=0
    # sub_thought_index=0
    # current_question=None
    # last_updated=datetime.datetime(2024, 11, 24, 17, 0, 0, 123456)
    # skills=[]
    # session_metadata=SessionMetadata(session_id='default_session')

    # Create a user state with a custom question
    user2 = UserState(current_question="What is Python?")
    print(user2)

    # Output:
    # thought_index=0
    # sub_thought_index=0
    # current_question="What is Python?"
